# How to deploy

1. Get the file id from admin (example: 720440)
2. open package.json and add to scripts:
```json
 "deploy": "npm run build; cd dist; kudu push -f HERECOMESMYFILEID;echo 'deployed'",
```

replace HERECOMESMYFILEID with your file id

3. run: ```sudo pip install kudu```
4. Place a kudu yml config file in your homedirectory `~/.kudu.yml` (Patrick or Josh can provide one)

From now on if you run:

```npm run deploy```

A new version will be uploaded and distributed.
You can add other entries in package.json if you need to upload to different instances.
