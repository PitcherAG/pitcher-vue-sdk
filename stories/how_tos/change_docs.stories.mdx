# How to change these docs
This documentation is written with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and served online using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from the `gh-pages` branch of the project.

## Quick start

### Content
Documentation files are located inside the `stories` folder as extended Markdown `.mdx` files which are essentially
a mixture of plain-old `Markdown` and `JSX`, read more about it [here](https://storybook.js.org/docs/vue/writing-docs/mdx#gatsby-focus-wrapper).

### Preview
In order to start the local Storybook dev server
```
npm run storybook
```
You can then preview the documentation in your browser on http://localhost:6006 

For more information about how Storybook is used, head over to the official [documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/vue/get-started/introduction).

### Customize menu items order
You can change the desired menu order of items in the left menu by editing the `.storybook/review.js` file

### Deploy Docs
In order to deploy the docs to GitHub Pages
```
npm run deploy:storybook
```
What the build script does under the hood is:
- Build files to `storybook-build` folder
- Push the contents of `storybook-build` folder to the `gh-pages` branch
- Delete `storybook-build` folder from the project

> Note: Storybook is served from the `gh-pages` branch of the project.  
> Once the deployment script is run it might take some time for the changes to appear live.
