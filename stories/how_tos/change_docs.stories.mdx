# How to change these docs
This documentation is written with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and served on GitHub Pages

## Quick start


### Content
Documentation is located inside the `stories` folder as extended Markdown `.mdx` files which are essentially
a mixture of plain-old `Markdown` and `JSX`, read more about it [here](https://storybook.js.org/docs/vue/writing-docs/mdx#gatsby-focus-wrapper).

### Preview
In order to start the local Story book dev server
```
npm run storybook
```
You can then preview the documentation in your browser on http://localhost:6006 

For more information about how Storybook is used, head over to the official [documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/vue/get-started/introduction).

You can change the desired menu order of items in the left menu by editing the `.storybook/review.js` file
