# Instance Actions
Here you can find actions that you can execute

## Exiting application
```javascript
import { exitApp } from '@pitcher/vue-sdk'

exitApp(options)
```

options may have a property named `buttonOptions` which defines the actions after exiting the app. If neither options nor buttonOptions provided, impact will ask actions with popup

| Value  | Action  |
|---|---|
 1  | Exit App without and do nothing after |
 2  | Exit App then restart impact  |
 3  | Exit App then restart impact and open current instance  |

 Example:
 ```
 exitApp({buttonOptions: 3})
 ```

## Showing an alert box
```javascript
import { showAlertBox } from '@pitcher/vue-sdk'

showAlertBox('my title', 'my message')
```
