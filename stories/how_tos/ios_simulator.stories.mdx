# Development Pitcher Impact on iOS

## Setup iOS simulator

1. Download the latest build of Pitcher Impact app, extract it somewhere on your hard drive
> We' re going to create a dummy project just to be able to start-up the simulator.
2. Open Xcode and select → Create new Xcode project → iOS platform → App.  
Fill out a product name for the project, click Next
3. Choose a location on your hard drive to save the project, click Create
> Be careful to uncheck the option `create Git repository on Mac`
4. Click the play button entitled "Build and then run the current scheme", at the top left
> This will open the iOS simulator
5. Choose your preferred iOS device e.g iPad Air (4th Generation), by right clicking the Simulator icon on the dock and navigating through the "Device" menu
6. We can now close Xcode and delete the created project as we won't be needing it anymore
7. For convenience you can keep the iOS simulator icon in the dock by right clicking its icon and selecting options → Keep in Dock
8. Drag and drop the Pitcher app from the location you've extracted it to the simulator's desktop

> You now have the Pitcher app installed inside the iOS simulator

## Pitcher Impact start-up
1. Open the Pitcher app inside the simulator.  
Make sure the orientation of the simulator is on landscape
2. Inside Pitcher app select Login with password → Login with SSO → use email
> You'll be redirected to your Microsoft 365 login screen, use your Microsoft account to authenticate
3. Once you are logged in, select your preferred instance then on the questions asked answer:
- Download Newest first
- Allow while using app
- Allow 
- Skip instructions
- Allow access to calendar
> In order to start debugging we must first launch an "Interactive" for the Safari debugger to be able to attach to.
5. Start watching the project's files for changes by running `npm run "ios watch link"` in the terminal
6. To enable the debugging console open Safari and select Preferences → Advanced → Show develop on bar for developing/debugging
7. Go to Develop menu and select the application you want to attach the debugger to  
e.g assuming you want to debug the "order taking" interactive go to: Develop → Simulator - iPad Air (4th Generation) iOS 14.0 → order taking
