# Docs How to

This documentation is written with docsify and served on github pages

## Quick start
It is recommended to install docsify-cli globally, which helps initializing and previewing the website locally.

```
npm i docsify-cli -g
docsify serve docs
```

This will server the docs located in the docs folder. The README.md is the index file.
