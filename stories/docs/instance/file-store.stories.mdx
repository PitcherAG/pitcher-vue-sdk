 ## Miscellaneous
 There are some criteria which decides if a file can be shown in UI. This are defined `shouldShowInUI` method
 - File should not be a thumbnail 
 - File typeV should not be one of 7,0,-1
 - File should not an image file (image files contain background and ccategory logos)
 - File should be ready and not expired (Any file can be distributed for a time period)

 When Instance is ready, Impact tells all files Ids that are downloaded and ready to be shown in UI also, These file Ids are retrieved in `initialAllowedIDs`. When user starts a call which has pre-selected content, Impact re-notifies UI with new allowed file Ids, which are store in `allowedIDs`

 It's UI's responsibility to filter files at a certain time based on this allowed Ids
