# How to change these docs

This documentation is written with [docsify](https://docsify.js.org) and served on GitHub Pages

## Quick start

### Content
Documentation is located inside the `docs` folder as Markdown `.md` files with `index.html` being the entry point
and `README.md` being the home page.  

### Installation
It is recommended to install `docsify-cli` globally, which helps initializing and previewing the website locally.

```
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

### Preview
Run the local server with
```
docsify serve docs
```
You can then preview the documentation in your browser on http://localhost:3000  

For more use cases of `docsify-cli`, head over to the [docsify-cli documentation](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify-cli).
