# Categories Store
Store for instance categories. Values are retrieved from serverJSON

| Property  | Description  |
|---|---|
 category  | Store the current category |
 categories  | All categories  |
 parentCategories  | Computed property for parent categories  |
 subCategories  | Computed property for child categories  |

 ## Miscellaneous

When serverJSON data is retrieved, initial category has to be set, or some functions may not work properly. This is done by `initializeInstance` function which is the starting point

Initial category is either the one as marked default or the last used category at earlier usage of the instance

If user is not a test device, categories contain only the ones user has a content in it.
